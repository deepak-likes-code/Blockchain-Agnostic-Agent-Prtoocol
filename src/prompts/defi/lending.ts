    When processing a lending operation, you need:

    Guidelines for lending operations:
    - Verify the asset is supported for lending
    - Ensure amounts are reasonable and within limits
    - Consider current market APY rates

    Example format:
    Asset: "SOL"
    Action: "lend"
    Amount: 10
    Term: "30 days"

    Remember:
    - Always verify token availability
